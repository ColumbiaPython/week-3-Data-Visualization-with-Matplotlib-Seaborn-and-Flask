# Multivariate Analysis and Data Visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn and Flask

The main goal of this lecture:

## Part one: class organization
1. introduce new students in the class (Yes, we have new students come every class......)
2. all students talk about the progress of their research proposal writing (due next week)

## Part two: programming

for all students

5. Multivariate Analysis: 
a. example question, concept, data analysis

for the new students only (a makeup 30min section after class)
1. terminal operation: call jupyter notebook, learn about 'pip install XXXXX'
2. notebook from week1: intro to Pandas, load dataset into jupyter notebook, data exploration analysis, data cleaning
3. notebook from week1: learn about data structure (Lecture_One_Data_Structure.ipynb)

## Part three: project management
1. make sure all students are the members of ColumbiaPython organization in Github
2. every student create individual project in ColumbiaPython (nameing: Project_lastname)
3. start writing proposal in github as a readme file
4. upload new files into github (reference papers, data & codes)


## Prepare for Next week
For Next Week: Introduction to Machine Learning for Classification

1. Logistic Regression: 
a. example question, concepts, data analysis
b. Do we really understand the Log Loss Calculation in Logistic Regression? Instead of Mean Squared Error for Linear Regression, we use a cost function called Cross-Entropy, also known as Log Loss for Logistic regression.
c. Binary Classification
d. One vs. Rest: Multiple Categories Classification

2. Naive Bayes:
Why Naive Bayes is naive?

3. SVM: 
Explain how SVM works.
What is the difference between SVM and Random Forest?
